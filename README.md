## Inspiration💡
Since the COVID outbreak, most events, fests and workshops have taken a turn to hosting virtually. The problem is, most of these events go unnoticed as most of us aren't moving around with cameras pointing at QR codes. We aim to build a solution, where in colleges will be able to access a dashboard which will contain the list of all future events and workshops so that people can access it all at one place. 

## What it does 🧭
On the backend, we are generating dynamic QR Codes with the help of Openscreen, these QR codes are then fetched by our backend and sent to our React web application. This is useful for the usecase where we have an event list and need to check all the workshops, fests, events scheduled. 

## How we built it 🔧


## Tech Stack 🔨
1. React.js
2. Node.js
3. Openscreen API
4. Git
5. JavaScript
6. GitHub

## Challenges we ran into 🏃‍♂️

1. To get the QR as images instead of object files with data was a challenge for us.
2. To post the QR codes from Openscreen to our React web application was difficult as we faced multiple issues in the integration. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏅
1. Created a working prototype where the QR codes are succesfully fetched and posted to our front end. 
2. Build the project use MERN stack which was our first time working in a full stack project. 

## What we learned 🧠
1. Openscreen method of QR generation.
2. Openscreen API to fetch and post QR codes to our Webapplication.
3. Integration of Node.js with React.js

## Inspiration💡
Since the COVID outbreak, most events, fests and workshops have taken a turn to hosting virtually. The problem is, most of these events go unnoticed as most of us aren't moving around with cameras pointing at QR codes. We aim to build a solution, where in colleges will be able to access a dashboard which will contain the list of all future events and workshops so that people can access it all at one place.
